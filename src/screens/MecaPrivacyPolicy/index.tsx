            MECA is a California nonprofit public benefit corporation that is
            recognized as tax-exempt under federal and state law. We do collect
            a variety of information identifying or identifiable to individuals
            (“Personal Information”) in pursuit of our charitable and
            educational activities.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            However, because MECA is a public charity, the majority of privacy
            laws are not applicable to MECA. In particular, no omnibus privacy
            laws of any U.S. state apply to MECA. If this were ever to change,
            this Privacy Policy would be updated to reflect those new
            obligations.

          <Title>4. Sensitive Information</Title>
          <Text>
            MECA does not use or disclose any sensitive information on you
            except to perform services reasonably expected by you, for fraud
            detection purposes, and to detect security incidents. For example,
            our Service Providers use payment information when you are making a
            donation to us. However, please be aware that, as stated above, our
            App vendor OnePali processes your Personal Information as a
            controller of that data, not our processor. Please refer to their
            Privacy Policy for their practices regarding sensitive information.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Sensitive information is defined by GDPR as Personal Information
            that reveals any of the following: (1) personal data revealing
            racial or ethnic origin, (2) political opinions, religious or
            philosophical beliefs; (3) trade-union membership; (4) genetic data,
            biometric data processed solely to identify a human being; (5)
            health-related data; or (6) data concerning a person’s sex life or
            sexual orientation. As a charitable organization focused on work
            that can be interpreted as political, your identity in association
            with your donation may be considered sensitive information under
            some privacy laws.

          <Title>5. If You Live Outside of the United States</Title>
          <Text>
            MECA's Services are hosted in the United States and are governed by
            United States law. If you are using the Services from outside the
            United States, please be aware that your information may be
            transferred to, stored and processed in the United States. The data
            protection and other laws of the United States might not be as
            comprehensive or protective of certain rights as those in your
            country. Under United States law, your information may be subject to
            access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the
            United States. By using the Services, you consent to your
            information being transferred to our facilities and to the
            facilities of those service providers with whom we share it as
            described in this Privacy Policy and processed in those facilities.

          <Title>6. Data Retention and Security</Title>
          <Text>
            We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will
            retain and use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to
            comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required
            to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve
            disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

            If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
            indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
            comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation
            queue.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            For users that register on our Services, we also store the personal
            information they provide in their user profile. All users have some
            options to update and remove their personal information in their
            user profile on their own at any time (except they cannot change
            their username). Service administrators can also see and edit that
            information.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal
            Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use,
            alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your
            information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where
            you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our
            Services, you are responsible for keeping this password
            confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable
            security for user personal information we process and maintain, no
            security measures can guarantee absolute safety and prevent all
            potential security breaches.

          <Text>
            As a public charity, the requirements of the Children’s Online
            Privacy Protection Act generally do not apply to MECA. However, MECA
            takes the privacy of children extremely seriously and, where
            possible, endeavors to ensure that additional protections for
            children’s data are extended in line with common standards. If
            collected in the course of performing our charitable mission, this
            information is processed under a lawful basis and treated with a
            high degree of confidentiality and care, with a focus on protecting
            the children in question.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            However, aside from the above, MECA does not knowingly collect the
            personal information of individuals under 18 years of age for the
            general use portions of our Services (e.g. the Website, our Apps,
            our fundraising activities, and the like). For those Services, if we
            discover that a child under 18 has provided us with personal
            information, we immediately delete this from our general purpose
            MECA servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that
            your child has provided us with Personal Information or is using our
            Services without your supervision or consent, please contact us so
            that we can take the necessary actions.
