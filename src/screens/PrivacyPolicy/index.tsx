            solicit donations for their charitable causes (the “Platforms”). Our
            work, and the various tools we use to support that work are
            hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Service(s).”

            We take your privacy and information very seriously. To that end, we
            have this Privacy Policy to advise you of our rules on handling the

            considered sensitive information under some privacy laws.

          <Title>EU/UK Legal Basis</Title>
          <Text>
            Where we process the data of an individual subject to GDPR or
            UK-GDPR, we do so on a number of legal basis. Depending on the type
            of information processed, our basis for processing can include: (1)
            your consent; (2) where necessary to perform a contract with you (3)
            where necessary for legal compliance purposes; (4) where such
            processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or
            another person; (5) where the processing is necessary to carry out a
            task of public interest; and (6) where the legitimate interests of
            OnePali or a third party allow it.

            legal basis and practices.
